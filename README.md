## Who, what, when, why?

I'm not a programmer by profession. But I enjoy it as a hobby. In the fall of 2016, I discovered an excellent and freely available pdf textbook of probability theory. This textbook made heavy use of computer simulations both in the chapter text and end-of-chapter exercises. The textbook itself does not contain the programs. There is however, what might be considered a [companion website](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html) for the textbook. It is here that programs written in Mathematica, Maple, and TrueBasic may be downloaded. 

Now it appears that the second edition of the textbook was published in 1997, which would make both it and the programs nearly 20 years old now. My goal is to recreate these programs in a modern programming language (Python version 3) and make them available on GitHub. 
 
## How?

The pdf textbook (named **introprob.pdf**) can be found in **mkwak73/probability**

Each chapter has its own folder. Each folder contains programs that are mentioned in the chapter text as well as the following subfolders:

1. **exercises** - contains the scripts that are the solutions for the end-of-chapter exercises 
2. **mathematica** - contains short mathematica scripts for those programs that require data visualization
3. **output** - contains output text files generated by exercise or chapter scripts that contain raw data which serve as input to the mathematica scripts

**To clone the repository to your local Linux machine or Mac:**
````
git clone https://github.com/mkwak73/probability.git
````

I conduct all of my coding on a Raspberry Pi myself.
